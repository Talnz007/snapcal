📋 NEXT STEPS:

1. Copy these files from the Claude artifacts into this directory:
   - index.html (from "SnapCal - Offline Math Solver" artifact)
   - sw.js (from "sw.js - Service Worker" artifact)  
   - manifest.json (from "manifest.json - PWA Manifest" artifact)

2. The files should be placed here in public/:
   public/
   ├── index.html
   ├── sw.js
   └── manifest.json

3. Then run: npm run dev (or python3 -m http.server 8000)

4. Open Chrome and visit: http://localhost:8000
